# IRCTC-Data-Engineering-Project-On-Premise

Created a synthetic IRCTC dataset using Python to mimic train booking records. Processed and analyzed the data using PySpark, applying transformations and aggregations to simulate real-world data engineering workflows. The project demonstrated hands-on skills in data preprocessing, schema design, and scalable batch processing in a local environment.
